  title: "Learning Multi-Scene Absolute Pose Regression with Transformers"
  venue: ICCV, 2021
  description: "We propose to learn multi-scene absolute camera pose regression with Transformers, where encoders are used to aggregate activation maps with self-attention and decoders transform latent features and scenes encoding into candidate pose predictions."

  title: "Introduction to Camera Pose Estimation with Deep Learning"
  venue: arXiv, 2019
  description: "We review deep learning approaches for camera pose estimation. We describe key methods in the field and identify trends aiming at improving the original deep pose regression solution. We further provide an extensive cross-comparison of existing learning-based pose estimators, together with practical notes on their execution for reproducibility purposes. Finally, we discuss emerging solutions and potential future research directions."
